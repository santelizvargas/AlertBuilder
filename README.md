## Features

- Fluent interface for building alerts.
- Support for setting alert titles, messages, and styles.
- Ability to add multiple actions with customizable handlers.
- Automatically adds a default "OK" action if no actions are specified.

---

## Installation

To use `AlertBuilder`, add the `AlertBuilder.swift` file to your project.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use `AlertBuilder` to create and present an alert:

```swift
let retryAction = AlertAction(title: "Retry") {
    print("Retry tapped")
}

let cancelAction = AlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel)

let alert = AlertBuilder()
    .withTitle("Error")
    .withTitle("Something went wrong")
    .addAlertAction(retryAction)
    .addAlertAction(cancelAction)
    .buildAlert()

present(alert, animated: true)
```
